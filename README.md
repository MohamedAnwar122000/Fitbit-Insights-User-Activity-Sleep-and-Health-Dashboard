# Fitbit Insights: User Health and Activity Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze health and activity data for Fitbit users. Using data for 20 users extracted from a database, the dashboard provides insights into user habits, including activity levels, sleep quality, and heart rate trends.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to prototype a Fitbit health and activity dashboard that allows for a detailed analysis of individual user metrics. It showcases trends in activity duration, sleep patterns, and heart rate metrics, providing Fitbit with insights to enhance user engagement and support health tracking.

## Datasets
The data used in this project includes the following key datasets:

- **Activity Dataset**: Tracks user activities, including types and durations.
- **Sleep Dataset**: Contains information on sleep quality metrics such as awake and asleep durations.
- **User Steps Dataset**: Logs step counts for users across different times.
- **Users Dataset**: Includes demographic and health details like resting heart rate and gender.
- **User Heartrate Dataset**: Tracks heart rate in relation to specific activities.

## Analysis Objectives
The dashboard addresses several key questions:

1. **Activity Patterns**: Which activities are most common, and do users favor certain days for specific activities?
2. **Sleep Quality**: What is the average sleep duration, and do users achieve optimal sleep efficiency?
3. **Heart Rate and Activity Correlation**: How does activity duration impact heart rate?
4. **WHO Exercise Recommendations**: Are users meeting the WHOâ€™s suggested 150 minutes of exercise per week?

## Skills and Techniques Used
This project leverages Power BI to connect, transform, and visualize data. Key Power BI skills and techniques include:

- **Data Connection and Transformation**: Using Power Query to connect to the database and prepare the data.
- **Calculated Columns and Measures**: Creating custom metrics for activity duration, sleep efficiency, and weekly exercise totals.
- **Time Intelligence Functions**: Analyzing patterns across different times and days.
- **Interactive Filters and Slicers**: Enabling user-driven exploration with filters for activity type, day, and gender.
- **Visualization**: Building bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to display user activity, sleep, and heart rate data.
